-----------------------

Mailto link
~~~~~~~~~~~

The mailto link opens the default mail program with the TO field already filled out. This link can be added to text or the arrow images. To add a mailto link, you simply write ‘mailto:someone@yoursite.com’ (replacing someone@yoursite.com with the desired email) into the add link section.

Important! Adding the mailto link to other images other than the arrow images will not work. Hubspot adds a http:// protocol which opens a new tab on the browser. Instead of opening the default mail program.
