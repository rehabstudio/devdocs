******************************
Make your life easier with Git
******************************

Git is a distributed revision control and source code management system with an emphasis on speed, data integrity and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.

As with most other distributed revision control systems, and unlike most clientâ€“server systems, every Git working directory is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version-tracking capabilities, independent of network access or a central server. 

Like the Linux kernel, Git is free software distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2.
